            This is how I spent my holiday. We visited my grandmother's house to
            spend time with her and my cousins. For your information, we always
            go to my grandmother's house every Christmas :). As you can see in
            the pictures, we took them to capture the memories. In the past, my
            cousins were little, but as you can see now, they have all grown up.
            It's heartwarming to see them. My grandmother's smile, as you can
            observe, is so charming. It's one of my favorite things that I get
            to see every Christmas.
